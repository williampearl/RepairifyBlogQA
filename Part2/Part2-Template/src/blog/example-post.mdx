Above this text is a header! That usually renders as an `<h1>` tag. What you're reading now is a paragraph, which is usually rendered as a `<p>` tag. You can also make text **bold** or _italic_, rendered as `<strong>` and `<em>` tags respectively. You can also make [links](https://www.repairify.com)!

While we're at it, here's a list of things you could use the experience gained from this workshop for:

- Creating a blog (of course)
- Creating a portfolio where each project has a writeup
- Creating an art gallery with information about the artist and art below the image(s)
- Creating a website for a small business
- Creating a website for a club or organization

Tell Philip that I finally used GraphQL for something work-related! I hope he's proud.
