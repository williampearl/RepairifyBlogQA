# Repairify Blog QA

Presentation on QA automation testing our Gatsby site.

## Directory Structure

You can open _Part1_ to find the complete project from our first presentation.
You can open _Part2_ to find our _Part2-Complete_ which contains all the files you need already finished, and _Part2-Template_ which will be where we are starting from in our presentation, writing the parts ourselves. _Part2-Complete_ can be used as a reference if you miss part of the presentation, or are confused by some of the code.

## Starting the Gatsby server

`cd` into whichever project you are using. For example, `cd Part2-Complete`. Run `npm i --force` to install the required npm packages (You will probably see warnings, its OK). Once everything is installed you can start Gatsby with `npm run develop`. You can find the URL in the console output, but it's probably http://localhost:8000/.
