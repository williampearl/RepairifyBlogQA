# Repairify Blog QA

Presentation on QA automation testing our Gatsby site.

## Directory Structure

You can open _Part1_ to find the complete project from our first presentation.
You can open _Part2_ to find our _Part2-Complete_ which contains all the files you need already finished, and _Part2-Template_ which will be where we are starting from in our presentation, writing the parts ourselves. _Part2-Complete_ can be used as a reference if you miss part of the presentation, or are confused by some of the code.
